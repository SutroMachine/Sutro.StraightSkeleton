# Sutro.StraightSkeleton

## License

This repository is based on an open-source project, [csharp-libs](https://github.com/reinterpretcat/csharp-libs). The original author is Ilya Builuk. This fork replaces the primitives with classes from [Sutro.geometry3Sharp](https://github.com/SutroMachine/geometry3sharp) for ease of use with other projects based on `Sutro.geometry3Sharp`, and adds some new functionality for external straight skeletons.
